# Tic-Tac-Toe bot (Minimax algorithm)

This is a sample Tic-Tac-Toe bot implemented using the most basic
Minimax algorithm. The Tic-Tac-Toe only has 9! = 362880 possible states,
so it is very easy to calculate the entire game.

This bot will never lose a game thanks to the problem space being so small.
